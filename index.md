This laser etched topographical map is a representative work of the impact that sea level rise could have on the La Jolla Shores area by the year 2150. According to government resources regarding climate change, it is projected that the sea level could rise an entire 3.9 meters, specifically around the United States, by 2150.
The map depicts a layer which represents the current sea level, and a layer of colored resin which emphasizes the difference that is predicted to be observed if current climate trends persist.

It is important to note that sea level rise is expected across the entire globe, impacting not only the communities depicted but also entire societies that are structured around living very near or on the shore. These individuals are affected unequally in comparison to anyone who lives further inland or anyone who is capable of relocating with little to no risk. This trend will continue to threaten peopleâ€™s lives, cultures, and the ecosystem as a whole unless action is taken.
